      "message": "This is a breaking but necessary change IMO, so we might as well do it now before everyone enables elf checks. Setting prefer: true makes the build not break even when BUILD_BROKEN_DUP_RULES is unset and you have vendor libs overriding source built ones.\n\nThis is especially annoying for pixel devices since their blobs change every 3 months and we are regenerating vendor blob lists automatically, but there is no way to see what libs are getting overridden.",
